# Precise Ultrasonic Sensor
This is a small script to calibrate ultrasonic sensor based on the environmental conditions, i.e. temperature and humidity.
As the speed of sound depends on these conditions, this small script calibrates default ultrasonic sensor distance calculation.
Both sensors as well as the base code is from Sunfounder
